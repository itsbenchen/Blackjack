# Blackjack
## Course Project for ICS 53L

### Overview: Black Jack
This is a C implementation of Blackjack. The game is basically similar to the 21 card game where the player(s) aim to get the highest hand value possible, which is 21.
Anything above 21 is considered "bust", which means that player loses. The goal of the game is to beat the dealer's hand without busting.
The dealer also plays along with the players, and the same rules apply to him/her. For each round of Blackjack, there will be an "Ante" or a minimum amount to bet to play for the round. For every win you receive, you get twice the amount you bet. This means that if you bet $20 and win, you'll receive $40 at the end of the round.

### What is this program?

The goal of this program is to exemplify how the game works at the basic level. You will be placed into a game with a dealer, where your goal is to beat the dealer. I have designed the game such that you'll be able to see all the cards in the dealer's hand. In normal circumstances, one card is always hidden in each hand. The game runs infinitely until you run out of money, or you decide to quit the game midway.

Note: There are some missing features in this version of Blackjack. e.g. Having more than one player and the "Double-down" option.
